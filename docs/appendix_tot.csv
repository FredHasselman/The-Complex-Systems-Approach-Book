Models of the behaviour of dynamic systems use difference or differential equations to describe the iterative processes hypothesized to underlie the temporal evolution

### **Bifurcation** {- #Bifu6}

+ A clearly observable qualitative change in the behavioural mode (attractor state) of a dynamic system associated with continuous change in one or more control parameters  (also known as Phase-, State-, or Order- Transition). The value of a control parameter at which a bifurcation occurs is often non-specific, or trivial

+ Visual summary of the succession of period-doubling bifurcations produced by gradual changes in the control parameter(s)

### **Catastrophe flags** {- #Cata8}

+ Markers indicative for a physical system that is described by a catastrophe. There are 5 'classical' flags and 3 'diagnostic' flags. Classical: bimodality, sudden jumps, inaccessibility, sensitivity & hysteresis. Diagnostic: divergence from linear response, critical slowing down and critical  fluctuations. Diagnostic flags can be used as early-warning signals. 

### **Catastrophe theory** {- #Cata9}

+ Mathematical research program describing how gradual change in some parameters can lead to disproportionately large changes in another parameter, called catastrophes (similar to bifurcations, Phase-, State-, or Order-transitions). 'This kind of behaviour has been summarized succinctly in the phrase "the straw that broke the camel's back".' (Gilmore, 1992).

### **Critical fluctuations** {- #Crit15}

+ An early warning signal for a phase transition that is characterised by an increase in fluctuations (variability) of the behaviour of the system. The increase occurs because the self-organised transition from one state to another relaxes the constraints on the degrees of freedom a system has available to generate its behaviour, allowing states and behavioural modes to appear that were previously inaccessible.

### **Critical slowing down** {- #Crit16}

+ An early warning signal for a phase transition that is characterised by an increase in the duration of relaxation times. If it takes longer for the system to return to the state it was perturbed from, this implies the emergence of a new stable state is imminent

### **Deterministic Chaos** {- #Dete17}

+ Behaviour of a dynamic system that "looks random, but is not" (Lorenz, 1973). The dynamics can be characterised as follows: 1) A-periodic, no point or trajectory in state space will exactly recur; 2) Sensitive dependence in initial conditions; 3) Bounded, not all theoretically possible degrees of freedom are available to the system; 4) The origin of this behaviour is deterministic, not stochastic

The functions, when explicit, are either difference equations or differential equations. Dynamic systems may be stochastic or deterministic. In a stochastic system, new values come from a probability distribution. In a deterministic system, a single new value is associated with any current value

+ “order is essentially the arrival of redundancy in a system, a reduction of possibilities”(Von Förster, 2003). Any form of non-random association or dependency that exists between parts of a system, its behaviour over time and/or its environment is a form of order. In scientific explanation of behaviour, the presence of order in non-artificial systems must be explained and should not be (implicitly) assumed.

### **Small world network** {- #Smal68}

+ Many real-world networks have a small average shortest path length, but also a clustering coefficient that is significantly higher than expected by chance. These networks are extremely efficient, each node in a very large network can still be reach in just a few steps (the 'six degrees of separation` phenomenon).
