["course-guide.html", "Course guide", " Course guide Complexity research transcends the boundaries between the classical scientific disciplines and is a hot topic in physics, mathematics, biology, economy as well as psychology and the life sciences and is collectively referred to as the Complexity Sciences. This course will discuss techniques that allow for the study of human behaviour from the perspective of the Complexity Sciences, specifically, the study of complex physical systems that are alive and display complex adaptive behaviour such as learning and development. Contrary to what the term “complex” might suggest, complexity research is often about finding simple models / explanations that are able to simulate a wide range of qualitatively different behavioural phenomena. “Complex” generally refers to the object of study: Complex systems are composed of many constituent parts that interact with one another across many different temporal and spatial scales to generate behaviour at the level of the system as a whole that can appear to be periodic, nonlinear, unstable or extremely persistent. The focus of many research designs and analyses is to quantify the degree of periodicity, nonlinearity, context sensitivity or resistance to perturbation by exploiting the fact that “everything is interacting” in complex systems. This requires a mathematical formalism and rules of scientific inference that are very different from the mathematics underlying traditional statistical analyses that assume “everything is NOT interacting” in order to be able to validly infer statistical regularities in a dataset and generalise them to a population. The complex systems approach to behavioural science often overlaps with the idiographical approach of the science of the individual, that is, the goal is not to generalise properties or regularities to universal or statistical laws that hold at the level of infinitely large populations, but to apply general principles and universal laws that govern the adaptive behaviour of all complex systems to study specific facts, about specific systems observed in specific contexts at a specific instant. The main focus of the course will be hands-on data-analysis and the main analytical tool we will use is R (if you are an expert: It is also possible to use Matlab for most of the assignments, let us know in advance). Practical sessions will follow after a lecture session in which a specific technique will be introduced. We will cover the following topics: Theoretical background of phase transitions (self-organised criticality) and synchronisation (coupling dynamics) in complex dynamical systems and networks. Simple models of linear and nonlinear dynamical behaviour (Linear &amp; logistic growth, Predator-Prey dynamics, Lorenz system, the chaos game); Analysis of long range dependence in time and trial series (Entropy, Relative roughness, Standardized Dispersion Analysis, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis). Quantification of temporal patterns in time and trial series including dyadic interactions (Phase Space Reconstruction, [Cross] Recurrence Quantification Analysis). Network analyses (Estimating symptom networks, calculating network based complexity measures) "],
["teaching-formats.html", "Teaching formats", " Teaching formats Each meeting starts with a lecture addressing the theoretical and methodological backgrounds of the practical applications that will be used in hands-on assignments during the practical sessions. Several meetings include a part where guest lecturers discuss the use of one or more techniques in their recent research. Preparation To prepare for each lecture students read a contemporary research paper or watch a videolecture (e.g., TED) featuring complexity theory and its application on a topic in behavioural science that will be discussed in the subsequent lecture. Students are required to formulate questions about each paper, and to initiate a discussion with their fellow-students on Blackboard. Before each lecture, students should: Read (parts of) a scientific article, or watch a videolecture featuring a complex systems perspective and/or methodology. Ask (or answer) a question about what they have read / seen in the appropriate discussion forum on Blackboard. The answers students provide will be discussed during the lecture.

["learning-objectives.html", "Learning objectives", " Learning objectives Specific Students who followed this course will be able to: Critically evaluate whether their scientific inquiries can benefit from adopting theories, models, methods and analyses that were developed in the Complexity Sciences to study the structure and behaviour of complex adaptive systems. Understand the differences between using an independent-statistical-component-dominant causal ontology, versus an interdependent-dynamical-interaction-dominant approach to the scientific study of human behaviour. Understand and apply important terms to describe behavioural change and adaptation: Nonlinear dynamics (e.g. hysteresis), attractor state, order parameter, control parameter, state-space, phase-space, phase transition, self-organisation, emergence, synergies as coordinative structures. Simulate linear, nonlinear and coupled growth using simple mathematical models in Excel and R (or Matlab). Fit parameters of simple models of linear and nonlinear growth to real data in SPSS or R (or Matlab). Perform analyses on time and trial series of human performance and physiology that quantify the presence and nature of scaling relations (fractal geometry) in continuous or categorical data in R (or Matlab). Perform analyses on time and trial series of human performance and physiology that quantify the presence and nature of temporal patterns (recurrent trajectories in phase space) in continuous or categorical data data in R (or Matlab). Perform network analyses on datasets that may be considered static or dynamical representations of social networks, or symptom networks (psychopathology) in R. Understand the results from analyses in terms of early warning signals indicating a phase transition might be imminent. Understand the results from analyses in terms of synchronisation and coupling phenomena, e.g. “complexity matching” and “leading/following” behaviour. General At the end of this course, students have reached a level of understanding that will allow them to: Study relevant scientific literature using a complex systems approach to behavioural science. Getting help with using a complex systems approach in their own scientific inquiries, e.g. by being able to ask relevant questions to experts on a specific topic discussed during the course.

["a-quick-guide-to-scientific-rigour.html", "Chapter 2 A Quick Guide to Scientific Rigour", " Chapter 2 A Quick Guide to Scientific Rigour The scientific method consists of all philosophical, theoretical and empirical tools, procedures and methods that can be used to systematically evaluate the veracity of explanatory claims about the structure of reality. The repeated application of the scientific method to study scientific questions promises to generate valid inferences and reliable facts about a certain explanatory domain. The validity of scientific inferences is of course always conditional on the perceived veracity of the body of scientific knowledge from which the inferences were derived. Less tangible, but not less important for the perceived veracity of scientific knowledge are concepts such as intellectual honesty en scientific integrity of scientists laying explanatory claim on some observable phenomena. Simply applying the scientific method to any problem in science doe not fully grasp all the characteristic that constitute a solid body of scientific knowledge. We will use the term rigorous science (Casadevall &amp; Fang, 2016) to denote the ideal set of conditions to allow the scientific method to separate claims that are likely to be false, from claims that are likely to be true (given the current scientific record). Figure 2.1: Rigorous Science according to Casadevall &amp; Fang (2016). When a claim is based on Scientific Rigor, we refer to the fact there has been: Experimental Redundancy - The claim has been examined by all methodological and analytical tools that are available and are appropriate given the context. Rigorous Science does not rely on one type of experimental design or one type of statistical analysis. Recognition of Error - Without failure there can be no progress, therefore we should carefully study failures and not just report success stories. Any sources of error should be carefully studied and reported to the scientific community. Sound Probability &amp; Statistics - Use of the most recent and appropriate statistical theories, models and analytical techniques. Statistical models become more realistic and often the models that were taught in undergraduate statistics courses have long been replaced and should not be used any more. Efforts to Avoid Logical Traps - When generating theories, defining constructs and laws, make sure logical inconsistencies are avoided. When making inferences, avoid the common logical traps such as The Effect = Structure Fallacy in null hypothesis significance testing: If a predicted effect is observed (i.e. a statistically significant test result leads to a rejection of the null hypothesis), it is not valid to infer that the existence of the assumed cause was evidenced. Intellectual Honesty - Rigorous science is ethical, has integrity and thrives on critical reflection on scientific practice. The right mindset is “Prove yourself wrong!”, not “Prove yourself right!” Figure 2.2: xkcd on the ‘purity’ of scientific disciplines. "],

["introduction-to-complexity-science.html", "Chapter 3 Introduction to Complexity Science", " Chapter 3 Introduction to Complexity Science Psychological systems are biological systems which are physical systems that are alive. Therefore, any theory that lays explanatory claim to phenomena of the mind, ultimately must be a theory about how a physical system is able to accumulate non-random order into its internal structure that appears to codetermine its behaviour. Less formally stated, a science that studies the behaviour of physical systems that are alive, that appear to have a memory which makes their behaviour adaptive, future oriented, intelligent, should in principle be grounded in physical and biological principles and laws. That may be a bridge too far for now, but such theories should at least not contradict highly corroborated theories of physics that describe the behaviour of the constituent components of living systems. The best way to describe the differences between the Machine Metaphor Approach (MMA) and the Complex Systems Approach (CSA) to study human behaviour is to examine what theories generated using the each approach The Complex Systems Approach to Behavioural Science is mainly concerned with understanding be described as science Such behavior is often called ‘adaptive’ to indicate that the same external states could elicit different behavioral responses depending on the temporal order in which they occur (e.g. reward before vs. after an electric shock; cf. Gibson (1966), Walker (1972)). One important requirement for dependence of system behavior on the temporal order of event occurrences, is that the physical composition of the system must permit specification of its internal structure by the particular facts pertaining to the events (see e.g. M. T. Turvey &amp; Shaw (1999), Freeman, Kozma, &amp; Werbos (2001), Friston (2013)). If the after-effects of an interaction of the system with its environment are reflected by systematic changes to the internal structure of a system (e.g., evidenced as correlations between internal and external states such as ‘neural correlates’), the system can be characterized as a memory system. Specification of the physical structure of a system through after-effects of interactions (‘experienced’ events), is the only conceivable way to permit the coordination of behavior in the present (the Now) by the past (cf. M. Turvey &amp; Shaw (1979)). The Complex Systems Approach to Behavioural Science is mainly concerned with understanding be described as science The conception of particular facts as discrete internalized states dates back at least to 1904 when Richard Semon defined the engram' as the unique physiological trace left in the central nervous system by each stimulus and thing that an organism had experienced or learned ~\\citep*[see][]{Bruce2001a, McConnell1965a}. Related to the concept of the engram is theassociative chain theory’~ or `path theory’ of the central nervous system: “I refer to `path theory’, which states, roughly, that the functions of the central nervous system are controlled by chains of neurons laid down as a path so as to conduct the impulse to its appropriate end-organ: that the paths are strictly constant, thus accounting for the fact that the reflexes and reactions are largely constant: that learning consists of the opening up of new paths and that memory consists of the retraversing of some old path by another impulse.”&quot; — Ashby (1931, p. 148) Both the engram and path theory turned out to be elusive theoretical constructs. After a lifetime spent searching for the engram, Lashley announced his failure to detect it ~ and with respect to the emergence of order in sequences of behavior out of chains of associations: “I believe, that such interpretations of temporal organization are untenable and that there are, behind the overtly expressed sequences, a multiplicity of integrative processes which can only be inferred from the final results of their activity.”&quot; — Lashley (1951, p. 115) Gibson’s quoted vision of the brain as a self-tuning resonator was based on Lashley’s criticism of the brain as a storehouse (see Table~). The storehouse and path metaphors are apparently too compelling, especially in the behavioral-, cognitive-, and neurosciences (BCN science) the brain is commonly referred to as a storage medium ~ and overt behavior as the result of executing a program ~. The internal, or mental representation is a modern version of the engram and plays a crucial role in modern theorizing about intelligent behavior. Remarkably, despite its importance as a theoretical entity, a formal definition is missing. In terms of a physical system, internal representation refers to: \\textit{an identifiable physical state within a system that stands in for another (internal or external) state and that as such plays a causal role in (or is used by) the system generating its behavior}''~\\citep*[][p. 6]{Haselager2003a}. From a realist perspective, any theory about mental phenomena that makes use of internal representations and imprinted `paths' or `traces' to explain adaptive behavior, will have to explain how the system was specified to represent (aspects of) an interaction event. In BCN science, this is generally neglected and many accounts of the physical realization of adaptive behavior must be characterized as `feigned physicalism'. Ashby already noted in 1931, that the path theory~. The goal of this article is to introduce a number of physical principles and explanatory tools that allow the development of a formalism for complex adaptive behavior based a conception of computation that respects the physical medium of implementation~. A formalism for Radical Embodied Computation (REC++) should describe order generation inside brains nested in bodies that can explain phenomena of the mind departing from principles of Information Realism ~. REC++ can be described as an attempt to merge Radical Embodied Cognition ~ and Physical Intelligence~ with Natural Computation ~. Potential issues with this objective are he explicit rejection of the use of information-theoretic constructs by REC in which: ``’’ ~ and the requirement by PI of information to become more than a measure of uncertainty ~. These and related issues will be discussed throughout the text. First, I will follow Ashbyâs lead and test the explanatory boundaries of Radical Neuronal Reductionism (RNR) that is commonly used as a causal ontology for adaptive behavior in BCN science ~. "],

A system is an entity that can be described as a composition of components, according to one or more organizing principles. The organizing prniciples can take many different forms, but essentially they decide the three important features of systems that have to do with the relationship between parts and wholes: What are the relevant scales of observation of the system What are the relevant phenomena that may be observed at the different scales Can interactions with the internal and external environment occur, and if so, do interactions have any effects on the structure and/or behaviour of the system 3.1.1 Open vs. Closed A closed system cannot exchange any energy, matter or information with the external environment. 3.1.2 Simple vs. Complex 3.1.3 Ergodic vs. Non-ergodic 3.1.4 Equilibrium vs. Far-from-equilibrium 3.1.5 Order vs. Disorder “order is essentially the arrival of redundancy in a system, a reduction of possibilities” — Von Förster (2003) The arrival of redundancy is an excellent description of what is meant by nonrandom behaviour. If the behaviour of a system is redundant, this means it is predictable to some extent and this just refers to the fact that behaviour covaries systematically (is correlated) with the behaviour of other parts of the system, or with changes in the external environment. The presence of redundancies indeed implies a reduction of possible states the system has available to generate its behaviour, the states a system can be in are in some way dependent on the temporal evolution of parts of the internal or external environment, they can no longer be occupied independently. This phenomenon id often described as a constraint on the degrees of freedom a system has available to generate its behaviour. The appearance of order always implies that states that were previously part of the behaviourial repertoire, are no longer accessible by the system. The opposite of order, disorder, or randomness, must then refer to the absolute absence of any redundancies, making reliable prediction of system behaviour impossible, or, equilly reliable to what may be expected by chance. The amount of disorder in a system can be quantified, a measure known as the Entropy of a system. 3.1.6 Order vs. Deterministic Chaos "],

["its-a-line-its-a-plane.html", "It’s a line! It’s a plane!", " It’s a line! It’s a plane! The formula resembles the equation of a line. There is a constant value \\(Y_{0}\\) which is added to a proportion of the value of \\(Y\\) at time \\(t\\), given by parameter \\(a\\). This is equivalent to the slope of a line. However, in a \\((X,Y)\\) plane there are two ‘spatial’ (metric) dimensions representing the values two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) can take on (see figure). The best fitting straight line would be called a statistical model of the linear relationship between the observed values of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). It can be obtained by fitting a General Linear Model (GLM) to the data. If \\(X\\) were to represent repeated measurements the multivariate GLM for repeated measures would have to be fitted to the data. This can be very problematic, because statistical models rely on Ergodic theory: “… it is the study of the long term average behavior of systems evolving in time.”2 need to assume independence of measurements within and between subjects. These assumptions can be translated to certain conditions that must hold for the model to be valid, known as Compound Symmetry and Sphericity: The compound symmetry assumption requires that the variances (pooled within-group) and covariances (across subjects) of the different repeated measures are homogeneous (identical). This is a sufficient condition for the univariate F test for repeated measures to be valid (i.e., for the reported F values to actually follow the F distribution). However, it is not a necessary condition. The sphericity assumption is a necessary and sufficient condition for the F test to be valid; it states that the within-subject “model” consists of independent (orthogonal) components. The nature of these assumptions, and the effects of violations are usually not well-described in ANOVA textbooks;3 As you can read in the quoted text above, these conditions must hold in order to be able to identify unique independent components as the sources of variation of \\(Y\\) over time within a subject. This is the a clear example of: If you choose to use GLM repeated measures to model change over time, you will only be able to infer independent components that are responsible for the time-evolution of \\(Y\\). As is hinted in the last sentence of the quote, the validity of such inferences is not a common topic of discussion statistics textbooks.

["no-its-a-time-series.html", "3.4 No! … It’s a time series!", " 3.4 No! … It’s a time series! The important difference between a regular 2-dimensional Euclidean plane and the space in which we model change processes is that the \\(X\\)-axis represents the physical dimension time. In the case of the Linear Map we have a 1D space with one ‘spatial’ dimension \\(Y\\) and a time dimension \\(t\\). This is called time series if \\(Y\\) is sampled as a continuous process, or a trial series if the time between subsequent observations is not relevant, just the fact that there was a temporal order (for example, a series of response latencies to trials in a psychological experiment in the order in which they were presented to the subject). Time behaves different from a spatial dimension in that it is directional (time cannot be reversed), it cannot take on negative values, and, unless one is dealing with a truly random process, there will be a temporal correlation across one or more values of \\(Y\\) seperated by an amount of time. In the linear difference equation this occurs because each value one step in the future is calculated based on the current value. If the values of \\(Y\\) represent an observable of a dynamical system, the system can be said to have a history, or a memory. Ergodic systems do not have a history or a memory that extends across more than one time step. This is very convenient, because one can calculate the expected value of a system observable given infinite time, by making use of of the laws of probabilities of random events (or random fields). This means: The average of an observable of an Ergodic system measured across infinite time (its entire history, the time-average), will be the be the same value as the average of this observable measured at one instance in time, but in an infinite amount of systems of the same kind (the population, the spatial average).4 The simple linear difference equation will have a form of *perfect memory’ across the smallest time scale (i.e., the increment of 1, \\(t+1\\)). This ‘memory’ concerns a correlation of 1 between values at adjacent time points (a short range temporal correlation, SRC), because the change from \\(Y_t\\) to \\(Y_{t+1}\\) is exactly equal to \\(a * Y_t\\) at each iteration step. This is the meaning of deterministic, not that each value of \\(Y\\) is the same, but that the value of \\(Y\\) now can be perfectly explained form the value of \\(Y\\) one moment in the past. Summarising, the most profound difference is not the fact that the equation of linear change is a deterministic model and the GLM is a probabilistic model with parameters fitted from data, this is something we can (and will) do for \\(a\\) as well. The profound difference between the models is the role given to the passage of time: The linear difference equation represents changes in \\(Y\\) as a function of the physical dimension time and \\(Y\\) itself. The GLM represents changes in \\(Y\\) as a function of a linear predictor composed of additive components that can be regarded as independent sources of variation that sum up to the observed values of \\(Y\\). In other words: If you throw 1 die 100 times in a row, the average of the 100 numbers is the time-average of one of the observables of die-throwing systems. If this system is ergodic, then its time-average is expected to be similar to the average of the numbers that turn up if you throw 100 dice all at the same instance of time. The dice layed out on the table represent a spatial sample, a snapshot frozen in time, of the possible states the system can be in. Taking the average would be the spatial average this observable of die-throwing systems. This ergodic condiciotn is often implicitly assumed in Behavioural Science when studies claim to study change by taking different samples of individuals (snapshots of system states) and comparing if they are the same.↩ "],
